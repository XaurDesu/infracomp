	\chapter{Concurrency}
	Concurrency is the act of running different processes simultaneously 
	on a single machine by using separate processing instances, called Threads. 
	This practice is mainly done as a way to distribute the load 
	of a program on more than one thread. Most modern processing systems are made with
	multithreading in mind and therefore, use it for managing different programs at
	the same time.
